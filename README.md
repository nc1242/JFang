# Welcome to Lab1 

Here is our first lab of many to teach you the basics of programming! In the process I hope this teaches you the basics of Git and the foundation of processing NCS files.

## Getting Started 
Please install Python 2.7 along with an IDE to open and run python files. An alternative would be to download and install Virtualbox along with a free copy of Ubuntu to teach you the basics of bash scripting.

## Your Task
I have given you a template for an NCS file. Unfortunately the file is not formatted correctly to our standards and we need you to write this program to fix it. 

##Running the program
Run it from command line using "python print.py testfile"

### Part 1
Modify the print statement to print out the contents of the file

### Part 2
We can't have double pipes - ||. Your task is to write one line of code that replaces || with |0|.

### Part 3
You might have noticed that part 2 was an incomplete solution. We still have occurences of double pipes as we see here: |0||0|

### Part 4
Almost there! We have lines that end in a pipe |. Rather than ending in a pipe, append a 0 to the end of the line
